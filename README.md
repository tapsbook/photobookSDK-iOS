The SDK provides three ready-to-use components to help you integrate our photo book solution within an hour.

1. Simple yet powerful photo book tool for your users to quickly create photo book in a few minutes
2. Beautiful, fully customizable photo book page templates featuring your own branding/logo

The SDK is integrated with the backend system via REST API to manage the photo book printing workflow by working with our photo book print partners and shipping service providers to offer you a turnkey photo merchandising solution.
