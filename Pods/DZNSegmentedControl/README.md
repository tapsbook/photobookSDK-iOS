## Installation

Available in [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=DZNSegmentedControl)
```
pod 'DZNSegmentedControl'
```

## How to use
For complete documentation, [visit CocoaPods' auto-generated doc](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DZNSegmentedControl/)

### Step 1

```
Import "DZNSegmentedControl.h"
```

### Step 2
Creating a new instance of DZNSegmentedControl is very similar to what you would do with UISegmentedControl:
```
NSArray *items = @[@"Tweets", @"Following", @"Followers"];
    
DZNSegmentedControl *control = [[DZNSegmentedControl alloc] initWithItems:items];
control.tintColor = [UIColor blueColor];
control.delegate = self;
control.selectedSegmentIndex = 1;
    
[control addTarget:self action:@selector(selectedSegment:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
````

You can additionally set more properties:
```
[control setCount:@(12) forSegmentAtIndex:0];
[control setTitle:@"Hello" forSegmentAtIndex:1];
[control setEnabled:NO forSegmentAtIndex:2];
````
