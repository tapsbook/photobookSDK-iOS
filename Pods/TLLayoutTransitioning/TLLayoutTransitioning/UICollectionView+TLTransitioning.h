/**
 Calculate the final content offset for the given transition layout that place the
 specified index paths at a particular location. Specify a single index path for pinching
 or tapping a cell. Specify multiple index paths for pinching a group of cells,
 for example, like a stack of photos. Numerous options are provided to fine-tune
 the placement.
 
 @param layout  the transition layout instance
 @param indexPaths  the collection of index paths to consider for placement
 @param placement  the type of placement, e.g. Center
 @param placementAnchor  the relative placement anchor point. Specify kTLPlacementAnchorDefault
                         for the default anchor, which varies by placement type.
 @param placementInset  the inset on the collection view's frame for placement.
                        Specify UIEdgeInsetsZero for no inset.
 @param toSize  The expected "to" size of the collection view's frame. Use this
                option when resizing the collection view during the transition.
                Specify `collectionView.bounds.size` when not resizing.
 @param toContentInset  The expected "to" content inset. Use this option when
                        modifying the content inset during the transition. Specify
                        `collectionView.contentInset` when not changing the inset.

 The `placement` argument determines how the content offset is calculated. Regardess
 of the placement type, the caculations are based on the union of all frames in the
 given collection of `indexPaths`, i.e. the placement frame. The `placementAnchor`
 and `placementInset` arguments can be used to further control the placement behavior.
 
 The `placementAnchor` argument specifies the relative point in the placement frame
 for which the offset is calculated. For example, the Minimal placement type has a 
 default placement anchor of {0.5, 0.5}, which means the movement of the center of
 the placement frame is minimized. However, a placement anchor of {0.5, 0} will
 minimize the movement of the top-center point.
 
 The `placementInset` argument insets the placement frame. For example, the Visible
 placement type will position a hidden cell along the edge of the collection view.
 To provide a margin between the cell and the edge of the collection view, specify
 a positive inset, such as {20, 20, 20, 20}.
