/**The shared TBSDKAlbumManager object provides methods for creating a new photo gifting order, retrieving a list of all photo books for viewing and editing, or presenting the checkout views and submitting orders for manufacturing.

 **To create a new order**

 1. Create and prepare an array of TBImage objects, each object representing a photo to be inserted into the book. The order of the photo in the array will be used to present the photos in the pages. See TBImages for details of preparation steps including importing images before page rendering.

 2. Use createSDKAlbumWithImages:identifier:title:tag:completionBlock: method to create the book

 3. Call openSDKAlbum:presentOnViewController:shouldPrintDirectly: to open the book for viewing and editing

 **To check out an order using SDK workflow**
 
 The Tapsbook SDK provides very flexible checkout integration options. There are three options for you to add the checkout UX to your app:
 
 1. Using SDK built-in checkout views and the Tapsbook eCommerce
 
 1. Using your checkout views and the Tapsbook eCommerce
 
 1. Using your checkout views and your eCommerce
 
The detail discussion of each option can be found here: Checkout guide [English](https://github.com/tapsbook/photobookSDK-iOS/blob/master/Doc/developer-guide-checkout.md) and [Chinese](https://github.com/tapsbook/photobookSDK-iOS/blob/master/Doc/developer-guide-checkout-cn.md)
 
 **The order manufacturing process**
 
 Once your app user checks out and submits an order, tapsBook platform backend will manage an automated manufacturing workflow
 
 1. The tapsBook platform notifies the user confirming the order has been received.
 
 2. The manufacturer prints the photo book and ships it to your app user via a pre-selected shipping provider
 
 3. The tapsBook platform notifies the user with the shipping information and tracking #
 
 **To retrieve a list of existing books**
 
 You can optionally render a list view showing all the books users have created. From here user can continue to edit a previously created book, or reorder a book.
 
 Use allSDKAlbumsWithCompletionBlock: method to retrieve an array of TBSDKAlbum objects, alternatively, if you created these Albums with tags, you can use allSDKAlbumsOfTag:completionBlock: to only retrieve a subset of TBSDKAlbum that matching the tag.
 
 **To view a list of submitted orders**
 
 The SDK provides ready-to use UI showing all the books orders users have submitted. From here user can view the order status.
 
 Notice SDK backend tracks users order via TBSDKUser. To allow SDK tracks your user oders including view order status later, you must first sign in your current app user to SDK by calling signinSDKUser:fromApp:completionBlock:. After this, you can use orderListViewController to list the order  made by the signed in app user.
 
 **The Tapsbook data model explained **
 
 Behind the scene, TBSDKAlbumManager intelligently creates a photo book by populating book pages to fit the selected images meeting the photo book manufacturing specification. The SDK will create a TBSDKAlbum object and apply a page layout template to place these TBImage on the page. The SDK embeds its own template data store containing hundreds of beautiful hand-crafted page layouts templates. Enterprise account developer has the option to customize these templates or add their own templates.
 
 A TBSDKAlbumManager object can have a object adopting TBSDKAlbumManagerDelegate protocal. The delegate receive messages from a TBSDKAlbumManager, and their responses to these messages enable them to affect the operation of an album creation or to trigger certain actions to be performed in your app, such as refreshing an album list view after user has completed editing a photo book.
 
 TBSDKAlbumManager stores the  TBSDKAlbum object and its page meta data in a local data store. To reduce SDK local disk usage, it always renders the images when needed and delete them after the order has been submitted. It is recommended you clean the imported images in your app to reduce the disk usage.  When the TBSDKAlbumManager opens the book for viewing and editing, it uses lazy load and caching for the images to minimize the memory footprint while ensure an optimal user experience.
