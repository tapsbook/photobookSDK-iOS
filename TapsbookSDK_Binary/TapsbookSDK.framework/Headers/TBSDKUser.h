/**
 TBSDKUser represent an user at the SDK backend. SDK backend uses a user registry to associate 3rd party user  with the user's orders. The user registry uses the pair {app_name, app_user_id} to uniquely identify a user.
 
 In order to let the SDK tracks and manages the user order, you must call [TBSDKAlbumManager signinSDKUser:fromApp:completionBlock:] Once you signed in your app user, you can call [TBSDKAlbumManager orderListViewController] to show the orders made by the signed in app user.
 
 The following example demonstrates the typical preparation steps.
 
     if (![TBSDKAlbumManager sharedInstance].currentSDKUser){
         [[TBSDKAlbumManager sharedInstance] signinSDKUser:@"APP_USER_ID" fromApp:@"APP_ID" completionBlock:^(BOOL success, TBSDKUser *sdkUser, NSError *error) {
             if(success){
                NSLog(@"SDK user logged in. User name:%@", sdkUser.name);
             }
             else {
                NSLog(@"SDK user cannot log in. Error:%@", error.localizedDescription);
             }
        }];
     }
 
 You should always use the sign in method to get TBSDKUser instead of creating one by hand.
